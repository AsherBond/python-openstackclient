fixes:
  - |
    The ``addresses`` and ``flavor`` fields of the ``server show`` command will
    now be correctly rendered as a list of objects and an object, respectively.
  - |
    The ``networks`` and ``properties`` fields of the ``server list`` command
    will now be rendered as objects. In addition, the ``power_state`` field
    will now be humanized and rendered as a string value when using the table
    formatter.
